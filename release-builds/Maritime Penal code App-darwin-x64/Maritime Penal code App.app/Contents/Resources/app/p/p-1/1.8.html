    <h1 id="penalCodeHeader">(1)08. Attempted Murder</h1>
    <h3 id="penalCodeSubHeader">
      <strong>1)</strong> A person who deliberately and intentionally attempts
      to kill or cause life threatening harm to another person through
      premeditated actions. <br /><strong>2)</strong> A person who, by criminal
      accident, negligence, or in the heat of passion, causes severe or life
      threatening bodily harm to another person. <br /><br />
      - Penal Code (1)08 is a felony punishable by no less than 330 minutes and
      no more than 510 minutes.\n- If occurring by accident, negligence, or in
      the heat of passion, the perpetrator shall receive the minimum sentence.
      <br /><br /><strong>NOTES:</strong> Attempted Murder is a catch-all for
      any action that leads to severe bodily harm. Its range in imprisonment is
      intended to account for when such severe harm is premeditated or
      accidental.For accidents and negligence there must be evidence of foul
      play, criminality in the instance, or some other factor beyond a truly
      accidental incident. For example, injuring someone while speeding or
      intoxicated. <br /><br />((Aggravated Battery is much less severe and
      would not, for example, leave someone in a coma or brutally wounded
      script-wise. There is however also no guarantee that being brutally
      wounded means attempted Murder as it depends on how the situation is RPed.
