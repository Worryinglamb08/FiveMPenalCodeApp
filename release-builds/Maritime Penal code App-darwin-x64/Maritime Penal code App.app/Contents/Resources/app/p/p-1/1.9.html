    <h1 id="penalCodeHeader">(1)09. Manslaughter</h1>
    <h3 id="penalCodeSubHeader">
      <strong>1)</strong> A person who unintentionally kills another, with or
      without a quarrel or heat of passion.<br /><strong>2)</strong> A person
      who, through a criminal accident or negligence, causes someone's death.
      <br /><br />
      a) Vehicular Manslaughter - a person who unintentionally kills another
      with a land, air, and sea vehicles. <br /><br />
      - Penal Code (1)09 is a felony punishable by imprisonment of no less than
      240 minutes and no more than 360 minutes.\n- If occurring by accident,
      negligence, or in the heat of passion, the perpetrator shall receive the
      minimum sentence.<br /><br />
      <strong>NOTES:</strong> Manslaughter is murder that is not premeditated or
      proven to have intent or an opportunity to pause and reflect on killing
      that person. An opportunity to reflect (and therefore possibly change your
      mind) demonstrates premeditation and is murder. Manslaughter is only
      charged in the penal code when some sort of criminal negligence or action
      can be proven. Killing someone while driving drunk is manslaughter.
      Accidentally killing someone who jaywalks outside of a crosswalk is not
      criminal.
