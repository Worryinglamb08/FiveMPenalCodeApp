      (11)14. Street Racing
    </h1>
    <h3 id="penalCodeSubHeader">
      <strong>1)</strong> Performing an unlicensed or unauthorized vehicle race,
      performance, or competition on city, county, or state property<br />2)
      Performing a vehicle race on a hazardous private course.<br />
      3) Organizing, facilitating, or promoting a street race or other
      unlicensed or organized vehicle race or competition on city, county, or
      state property.<br /><br />
      - Road Law (11)14 is a misdemeanor punishable by no less than 20 minutes
      imprisonment and no more than 35 minutes imprisonment.<br /><br />
      NOTES: A “race” or “competition” is any event that reasonably should not
      be taking place on a road. A hydraulics competition, for example, or a
      race around the dockyards both apply under street racing. Any parking lots
      not considered owned by a particular business (such as the old bank
      parking lot in Mulholland) are considered public state property.
