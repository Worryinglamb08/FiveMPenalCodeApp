      <strong>1)</strong> No individual may be fined more than $25,000 in the
      course of a single road law incident in charges from Title 11. Road Law.
      <br />2) No individual may receive more than three driver warnings,
      amounting to a single license revocation, per road law incident.<br />3)No
      more than one of each code entry in Title 11. Road Law may be issued on a
      driver per road law incident.<br />4) A road law incident is defined as
      the moment an officer engages a person until the conclusion of that
      engagement or situation.<br />5) A peace officer is entitled to an
      exterior inspection of a vehicle, as well as verification of all
      paperwork, licenses, registrations, and other documentation during a
      traffic stop. A full vehicle inspection is permitted with a search warrant
      or appropriate probable cause.<br />6) Checkpoints, border controls, and
      other police operations on public roads must have a documented purpose,
      documented record of operations, and exist temporarily in response to (or
      in preparation to) a particular incident, holiday, etc.<br />7)A peace
      officer is only entitled to identify the driver of a vehicle when
      performing a traffic stop or other vehicle checkpoint operation, unless
      the passenger falls under a reasonable suspicion to be identified, such as
      matching an APB description. <br /><br />
      EXAMPLE: If an officer requests a driver to pull over, and the incident
      evolves into a pursuit, it is considered part of the same "road law
      incident" as it is a single, uninterrupted engagement. If the individual
      escapes or the pursuit is canceled, it is considered a conclusion to a
      single "road law incident." This means, for example, if a pursuit ends,
      and the suspect is discovered again, new charges may be issued if they
      continue to evade police.
