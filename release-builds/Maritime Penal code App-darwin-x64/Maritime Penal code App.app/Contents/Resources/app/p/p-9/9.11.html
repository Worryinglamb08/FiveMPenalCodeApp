      (9)11. Weapons Discharge Violation
    </h1>
    <h3 id="penalCodeSubHeader">
      <strong>1)</strong> A person who fires a firearm without due cause or
      justifiable motive regardless of registration status or legality. <br />
      2) A person committing this offense from a vehicle, whether land, sea, or
      in air, shall instead be charged with (9)12. Drive-By Shooting.<br /><br />
      - Penal Code (9)11 is a misdemeanor punishable by no less than 25 minutes
      imprisonment and no more than 35 minutes imprisonment, as revocation of
      the person's firearms permit for seven day if applicable. <br /><br />
      NOTES: This charge can stack with brandishing a firearm, so you can in
      fact be charged both. A discharge however is different from brandishing,
      which requires the perpetrator to be using the brandishing as a way to
      elicit fear or hysteria.
