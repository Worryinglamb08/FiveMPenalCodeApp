      (5)04. Vigilantism
    </h1>
    <h3 id="penalCodeSubHeader">
      <strong>1)</strong> A person who attempts to effect justice according to
      their own understanding of right and wrong, or an unauthorized person
      attempts to enforce the law. A citizen's arrest may only be effected when
      a civilian, out of fear for their own safety or the safety of their close
      friends or relatives, subdues or detains another who is violating the law.
      <br />2) A person who violates (12)10. Good Samaritan Clause. <br /><br />
      - Penal Code (5)04 is a felony punishable by no less than 90 seconds
      imprisonment and no more than 120 seconds imprisonment. <br /><br />
      NOTES: Vigilantism does not apply when a law enforcement officer in the
      vicinity is in need of immediate assistance, and a civilian aids such
      officer - for example, helping an officer apprehend an unarmed resisting
      suspect by holding him down.
