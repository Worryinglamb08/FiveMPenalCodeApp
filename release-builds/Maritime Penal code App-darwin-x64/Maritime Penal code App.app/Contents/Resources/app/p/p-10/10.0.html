      (10)00. Exception
    </h1>
    <h3 id="penalCodeSubHeader">
      <strong>1)</strong> Penal code entries, by default, may be modified by
      Sentencing Enhancements within Title 10. However, should a penal code
      entry be the exception to a Sentencing Enhancement or contain an exception
      within its description, then that exception shall be followed instead of
      the Sentencing Enhancement policy. <br />
      2) For example, (1)10. Murder cannot be charged for an attempt as an
      entire charge, (1)08. Attempted Murder, exists for that purpose. <br />
      3) Penalties are, as stated, stackable for each occurrence. Committing
      assault against someone multiple times is worthy of a charge for each
      time, as long as they are separate police incidents or occur at different
      times, or occur to different people. Charges can also be stacked for each
      person they are committed against. Unless an exception exists explicitly.
