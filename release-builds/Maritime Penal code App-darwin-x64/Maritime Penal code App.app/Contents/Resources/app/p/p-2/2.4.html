    <h1 id="penalCodeHeader">(2)04. Burglary</h1>
    <h3 id="penalCodeSubHeader">
      <strong>1)</strong> A person who enters into the locked or restricted
      property of another without their permission with the intention of
      committing a crime, typically theft. <br />2) This crime cannot stack with
      (2)02. Trespassing. <br /><br />
      - Penal Code (2)04 is a misdemeanor punishable by no less than 25 minutes
      and no more than 55 minutes imprisonment. <br /><br />
      NOTES: Burglary can include homes, apartments, offices, vehicles or any
      locked space with restricted access. Burglary is also committed irrelevant
      if any theft or other crime takes place. A less severe act of burglary is
      trespassing, which would account for instances where there is no intent to
      commit a crime, no locked door or other physical restriction.
