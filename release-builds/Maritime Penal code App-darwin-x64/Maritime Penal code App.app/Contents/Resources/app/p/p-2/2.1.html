    <h1 id="penalCodeHeader">(2)01. Arson</h1>
    <h3 id="penalCodeSubHeader">
      <strong>1)</strong> A person who intentionally and maliciously sets fire
      to or burns any structure, forest land, or property without prior
      authorization. <br />2) A person who intentionally aids, counsels, or
      helps facilitate the burning of any structure, forest land, or property
      without proper authorization. <br />3) A person who, through criminal
      accident or negligence, causes a fire to burn any structure, forest land,
      or property. <br /><br />
      - Penal Code (2)01 is a felony punishable by no less than 50 minutes and
      no more than 240 minutes. <br />
      - If occurring by accident or negligence, the perpetrator shall receive
      the minimum sentence. <br /><br />NOTES: Arson’s criminality is when
      someone intentionally creates or helps create a fire, as it can easily
      grow out of control and cause death. It is up to the Fire Marshal’s Office
      and investigating Law Enforcement Agency jointly to prove an arson was
      malicious and therefore criminal. Negligence or accident can be included
      if it is proven criminal in nature.
