      (12)08. Suspicion Policy
    </h1>
    <h3 id="penalCodeSubHeader">
      <strong>1)</strong> A peace officer's or court's justifiable suspicion of
      a person to commit or conspire to commit a crime is sufficient to allow
      that individual to be detained for questioning for no more than 60 minutes
      in police or court custody, however they cannot be searched beyond a legal
      Terry Frisk for the officerâ€™s safety unless probable cause or concurrent
      evidence emerges.<br />2) A person who is at the scene of a crime, riot,
      or major public disturbance may also be classified under the suspicion
      policy for temporary detainment.<br />
      3) Violation of this policy, or an act of justifiable suspicion that
      extends beyond legal bounds, extends beyond Color of Law and is
      satisfactory for suit.<br />4) A person who fails to identify themselves
      to a peace officer during arrest or arraignment shall be imprisoned for
      the maximum time allowed by the law until they can be successfully
      identified by a peace officer or the courts.
