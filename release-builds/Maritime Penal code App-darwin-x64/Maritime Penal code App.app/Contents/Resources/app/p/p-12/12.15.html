      (12)15. Probable Cause & Plain View Policy
    </h1>
    <h3 id="penalCodeSubHeader">
      <strong>1)</strong> Peace officers have the power to seize and record
      evidence upon any event that is in their plain view so long as they have a
      legal reason to be where they’re located at the time.<br />2) A person who
      gives a government employee permission to view or access a facility,
      equipment or other areas is permitting an officer to view a facility for
      probable cause or plain view evidence.<br />3) Probable Cause does not
      have a specific definition, but refers to the ongoing premise that an
      officer’s “gut feeling” supported by plain view evidence (such as the
      smell of marijuana or other items) that would imply a probable situation
      of criminality and authorize a search based on that evidence. Probable
      Cause can be circumstantially contested in a court of law.<br /><br />
      NOTES: Plain View applies even when an officer is in hot pursuit and
      enters, for example, an apartment complex and sees a clear criminal act in
      progress while chasing someone. They can call in other units to seize and
      handle that situation too.
