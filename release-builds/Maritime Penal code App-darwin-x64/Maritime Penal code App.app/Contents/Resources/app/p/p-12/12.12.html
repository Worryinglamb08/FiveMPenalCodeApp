      (12)12. Maximum Imprisonment
    </h1>
    <h3 id="penalCodeSubHeader">
      <strong>1)</strong> A person cannot be imprisoned for longer than 900
      minutes despite the number of charges on this individual exceeding a 900
      minute penalty, unless said sentence is approved by a Justice of the
      Courts of San Andreas, the Attorney General, or by the Governor of San
      Andreas.<br />2) A person who cannot be effectively identified shall be
      imprisoned for 900 minutes until they can be properly identified or they
      fulfill the 900 minute imprisonment. If they are identified, the total
      time served will be deducted from the time due, with immediate release if
      they fulfilled more than the total time. A person released with more time
      spent in prison than their charges yield is not subject to excessive or
      wrongful imprisonment<br />
      3) At the Governorâ€™s discretion, an individual who commits a felony may
      qualify for death row status, yielding permanent imprisonment unless the
      Governor issues a pardon.
