      <strong>1)</strong> A person who commits any offense in response to
      immediate threats to kill from a third party and does so in order to
      negate those threats cannot be found to have had the required criminal
      intent with which to be held liable for an offense. <br />
      2) The only exception to this are severe crimes against the person, such
      as torture, murder, and attempted murder, as it is not justifiable to take
      or severely harm another life unless in an act of self defense.
