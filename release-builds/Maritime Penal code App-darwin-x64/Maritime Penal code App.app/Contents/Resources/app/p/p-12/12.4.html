      (12)04. Necessity
    </h1>
    <h3 id="penalCodeSubHeader">
      <strong>1)</strong> A person who commits an offense out of necessity to
      protect themselves or others from significant bodily harm or emergency,
      has no adequate legal alternative, did not create a greater danger through
      their actions and held an actual and reasonable belief that their action
      was necessary to prevent harm, will be absolved of criminal liability for
      the offense deemed to be committed as a necessity to prevent greater harm.
      <br />
      2) This defense cannot be applied in cases of gang on gang violence or in
      other such instances where the party claiming the defense was put at risk
      of immediate danger by their own involvement with actionable criminality.
