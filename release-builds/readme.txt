Hey there fellow police officers,

Let's start how you use this app!

1. Extract the folder to where ever you want (remember this location for step 2)
2. Goto the folder that you extracted and select the "maritime-penal-codes-app.exe", right click > send to > Desktop (create shortcut)
3. Open the app 
4. Don't be alarmed when it says "Welcome, undifined"! To fix this, Settings > Username just press "apply" or put in a real username and press apply
5. All done!


Let me know if there's any problems or bugs.
