      (11)06. Vehicular Endangerment
    </h1>
    <h3 id="penalCodeSubHeader">
      <strong>1)</strong> A person who demonstrates extreme carelessness while
      operating a vehicle, such as by nearly striking pedestrians, entering
      pedestrian passageways or nearly causing the severe harm of other
      motorists.<br />2) A person who uses their vehicle in any manner that is
      dangerous to passengers, pedestrians, or nearby residents. <br />
      3) A person who drives on railroad tracks, busy pedestrian passageways or
      plazas, or on the opposite lane of travel with vehicles present, or on the
      opposite lane of travel on any freeway or highway.<br />
      4) Any activity that would be considered (11)05. Reckless Driving, but
      takes place within close proximity to nearby civilians, or in dense
      traffic.<br />5) This cannot stack with (11)05. Reckless Driving.<br /><br />
      - Penal Code (11)06 is a misdemeanor punishable by impoundment of the
      individual’s vehicle with imprisonment of no less than 15 minutes and no
      more than 25 minutes.<br /><br />
      NOTES: Vehicular Endangerment cannot stack with reckless driving and is
      considered a more severe form of reckless driving. It serves as a
      catch-all for when an officer determines someone’s driving or usage of a
      vehicle to be beyond safe, reasonable activities. Also take note that this
      charge does stack with hit and run. Someone who commits a hit and run
      (hitting any vehicle or person and driving away) can be charged for each
      occurrence during the course of a road law incident. Per Limitations a
      driver can only receive either reckless driving or vehicular
      endangerment<br />ONCE per road law incident.
