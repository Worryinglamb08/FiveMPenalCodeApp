      (9)10. Brandishing A Firearm
    </h1>
    <h3 id="penalCodeSubHeader">
      <strong>1)</strong> A person who is pointing, holding, or brandishing a
      firearm, air or gas operated weapon, or object that appears like a firearm
      without proper toy and prop identification in an attempt to elicit fear or
      hysteria. <br />
      2) A person holding an object in a manner similar to a firearm who
      attempts to elicit the same fear or response as brandishing an actual
      firearm. <br /><br />
      - Penal Code (9)10 is a misdemeanor punishable by no less than 20 minutes
      imprisonment and no more than 30 minutes imprisonment, as well as
      revocation of the person's firearms permit if applicable.<br /><br />NOTES:
      Brandishing explicitly notes that the purpose is to elicit fear or
      hysteria. A Weapons Discharge violation is irrelevant of the intent to
      elicit hysteria so the two charges can be stacked if appropriate.
