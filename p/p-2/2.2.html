    <h1 id="penalCodeHeader">(2)02.Trespassing</h1>
    <h3 id="penalCodeSubHeader">
      <strong>1)</strong> A person who enters anotherâ€™s property while it is
      closed or not in operation without the expressed or written permission to
      do so. <br />2) A person who enters the restricted area of an open
      facility or property as defined and clearly marked by the property manager
      without the expressed or written permission to do so. <br />3) This cannot
      stack with (2)03. Trespassing within a Restricted Zone. <br />4) This
      crime cannot stack with any form of Burglary. <br /><br />
      - Penal Code (2)02 is a misdemeanor punishable by $2,000 AND an
      imprisonment of 10 minutes. This falls under Officer Discretion.<br /><br />NOTES:
      Trespassing refers to anyone who is told to leave and refuses to do so,
      but lacks any intention of committing a crime or other malice aforethought
      or action. Burglary is a far more severe act of trespassing as it comes
      with evidence of criminal intent.<br /><br />
      If police close down a public space it is trespassing to enter that public
      space without their authorization. The same applies if a typically public
      space is temporarily closed.<br /><br />
      Owners of trailers or caravans may only consider their trailer or caravan
      their own property. The surrounding trailer park is not considered their
      own property when the area includes several other trailers and caravans
      that are not owned by one individual.
