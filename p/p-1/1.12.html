    <h1 id="penalCodeHeader">(1)12. Kidnapping</h1>
    <h3 id="penalCodeSubHeader">
      <strong>1)</strong> A person who detains or arrests another without their
      consent (or the consent of their guardian) with the premeditated intent to
      do so. <br />2) A person who detains or arrests another without their
      consent (or the consent of their guardian) for more than one hour. <br />
      3) A person who detains or arrests another without their consent (or the
      consent of their guardian) with the intent or decision to hold that
      individual for ransom of any kind. <br /><br />
      - Penal Code (1)12 is a felony punishable by no less than 270 minutes
      imprisonment and no more than 420 minutes imprisonment. <br />
      - If committed against a minor the perpetrator is punishable by the
      maximum sentence. <br /><br />NOTES: Kidnapping is defined by a more
      egregious act of False Imprisonment. Kidnapping is when the False
      Imprisonment is premeditated or planned, done for ransom (any reward or
      action in return for the personâ€™s safe return,) or for more than one hour,
      regardless of intent.
