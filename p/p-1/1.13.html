    <h1 id="penalCodeHeader">(1)13. Mayhem</h1>
    <h3 id="penalCodeSubHeader">
      <strong>1)</strong> A person who intentionally causes extreme pain and
      suffering to a person, with or without permanent damage to the body. \n 2)
      A person who causes pain and suffering for the purpose of revenge,
      extortion, persuasion, or for any sadistic purpose. <br />
      3) A person who intentionally disfigures, disables, or aggressively
      destroys or damages a body part or area of a body or personâ€™s body.
      <br /><br />
      - Penal Code (1)13 is a felony punishable by no less than 300 minutes
      imprisonment and no more than 450 minutes imprisonment. <br /><br />NOTES:
      Mayhem/Torture is in many ways a penal code entry to enhance other
      charges. Mayhem can be added to any change in an instance where the Mayhem
      took place while, or along with, the crime being committed. It is not
      automatically applied to charges that may be considered Mayhem (such as an
      Arson that leads to Murder) unless there is the demonstration of the
      perpetrator torturing someone specifically in that act of Arson.
      Ultimately it is up to the police to use this charge responsibly.
