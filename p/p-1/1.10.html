    <h1 id="penalCodeHeader">(1)10. Murder</h1>
    <h3 id="penalCodeSubHeader">
      <strong>1)</strong> A person who unlawfully kills another with malice
      aforethought. <br /><strong>2)</strong> A person who commits murder while
      engaging in a felony offense that has been proven to be a premeditated
      act. \n\n - Penal Code (1)10 is a felony punishable by no less than 510
      minutes imprisonment and no more than 660 minutes imprisonment.
      <br /><br /><strong>NOTES:</strong>
      Murder is defined clearly by a personâ€™s premeditated forethought or plan
      to commit the murder. Manslaughter happens in a heat of passion, by
      criminal negligence or accident, or for some other incident that is not
      expected. The only exception to this is when someone commits a planned
      felony, such as planning to commit an arson. If someone dies as a result
      of the premeditated arson, it is no longer manslaughter and instead
      murder.
