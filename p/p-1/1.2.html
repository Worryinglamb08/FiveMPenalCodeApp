    <h1 id="penalCodeHeader">(1)02.Assault</h1>
    <h3 id="penalCodeSubHeader">
      <strong>1)</strong> A person who intentionally puts another in the
      reasonable belief of imminent physical harm or offensive contact.
      <br /><br />
      - Penal Code (1)02 is a misdemeanor punishable by imprisonment of no less
      than 15 minutes and no more than 40 minutes. <br /><br /><strong
        >NOTES:</strong
      >
      Assault is defined by distance the threats occur. Someone a few feet away
      threatening to harm or kill you at any moment is assault. Intimidation is
      less severe as thereâ€™s a distance that someone can escape through, or that
      the perpetrator has more time to reconsider the threat. Any violent
      physical contact is considered to be battery, however grabbing someone
      during a threat may be either assault or battery, depending on intention
      and interpretation.
