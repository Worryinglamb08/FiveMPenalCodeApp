      (6)06. Sale Of A Controlled Substance
    </h1>
    <h3 id="penalCodeSubHeader">
      <strong>1)</strong> A person who sells, or offers to sell a controlled
      substance to another person, regardless of whether or not they possess
      that controlled substance. <br /><br />
      - Penal Code (6)06 is a felony punishable by no less than 90 minutes
      imprisonment and no more than 120 minutes imprisonment. <br /><br />
      NOTES: Since itâ€™s irrelevant of possession, this charge can indeed stack
      with whatever the present possession of a drug is on someone if they are
      in fact also in illegal possession of a controlled substance. This means
      anyone caught selling a controlled substance is also charged with whatever
      possessions they currently have too.
