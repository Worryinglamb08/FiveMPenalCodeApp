      (6)02. Possession Of A Controlled Substance With Intent To Sell
    </h1>
    <h3 id="penalCodeSubHeader">
      <strong>1)</strong> A person in possession of a controlled substance or
      multiple controlled substances in an amount of over one ounce (28 grams).
      <br /><br />
      - Penal Code (6)02 is a felony punishable by 30 seconds for every
      half-ounce (14 grams) of total controlled substances in possession upon
      arrest up to 600 minutes. Total possession is rounded up to the nearest
      half-ounce if the perpetrator has more than 28 grams. <br /><br />
      NOTES: At 28 grams or higher add 30 minutes for every 14 grams in total
      possession. If the perpetrator has, for example, 60 grams, which is 2
      ounces and 4 grams, charge them with 150 minutes, which is four half-ounce
      increments of 30 minutes (56 grams) and rounded up for the last half ounce
      (the next 14 grams or less.) <br /><br />
      (( Each drug (xx/xx) within inventory is considered 1 gram. ))
