    </h1>
    <h3 id="penalCodeSubHeader">
      <strong>1)</strong> A person who commits an offense but claims, and can
      display proof that they acted on the honestly held belief they were not
      violating the law or did not understand the law that was violated. <br />
      2) This can only negate an offense if the offense requires mens rea,
      meaning a willful intention, knowing, or understanding that they are
      committing a crime. <br />
      3) In any other cases, it may reduce the punishment for an offense at the
      discretion of the peace officer, or a judge when in a criminal suit.
