      (12)13. Wiretapping, CCTV & Videotaping Policy
    </h1>
    <h3 id="penalCodeSubHeader">
      <strong>1)</strong> The State of San Andreas shall have a one-party
      notification policy for wiretapping without appropriate surveillance
      warrants and authorizations.<br />2) A person who is found to violate
      these wiretapping laws can be charged with (13)09. Wiretapping
      Violation<br />3) Moles, bugs, and other illegal surveillance falls under
      wiretapping laws and violations / policies.<br />
      4) Government Employees may be recorded by civilians at all times when
      conducting their duties in an official capacity or when on-duty.<br />
      5) ((CCTV is considered reasonably accessible to the courts when sourced
      from inside and around all public facilities, from police dashcams, or
      when subpoenaed by a private business that claims to have CCTV cameras
      installed. Public CCTVs cannot be tampered, modified, stolen, or
      destroyed.))<br />
      6) ((CCTVs in businesses must be explicitly recorded as existing on
      paperwork or a license to be used in court or accepted legally.))<br /><br />
      NOTES: So long as one party (either person on the phone, in a facility, or
      other location where a conversation or event is being recorded) is aware
      of the situation it is considered a legal recording. Property owners
      always have full surveillance rights to their property and facilities,
      parking lots, etc. they maintain.
