      (12)17. Repeat Offender Clause
    </h1>
    <h3 id="penalCodeSubHeader">
      <strong>1)</strong> The District Attorney's Office, a representative of
      the Governor's Office, or a judge may charge a person who's arrested for
      at least one felony or misdemeanor, who has been previously convicted of
      at least one felony or misdemeanor, with this clause, which will increase
      the time due by one-hundred percent (100%) for the repeat offender.<br />
      2) A judge may issue an indefinite suspension to any license under the
      repeat offender clause when it has been demonstrated that the person is
      likely not to cease committing the offense in the future.<br />
      3) A judge may order the indefinite seizure of any vehicle used in the
      commission of the crime when it has been demonstrated that an individual
      is unlikely to cease committing the offense in the future and such vehicle
      was used in the commission of the crime.<br /><br />NOTES: A repeat
      offender is someone who has been to prison for a felony before and is now
      arrested for another felony. Only a (Deputy)District Attorney may charge
      someone with this and it'll double the criminal's time.
