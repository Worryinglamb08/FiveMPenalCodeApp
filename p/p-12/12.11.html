      (12)11. Imprisonment & Punishment Criteria
    </h1>
    <h3 id="penalCodeSubHeader">
      <strong>1)</strong> Only criminal violations that originate from the San
      Andreas Penal Code may carry a misdemeanor or felony-level punishment with
      imprisonment in a county or state penitentiary.<br />
      2) All felonies must carry with their punishment imprisonment at the San
      Andreas State Correctional Facility.<br />
      3) All persons convicted of more than 45 minutes imprisonment will carry
      their sentence at the San Andreas State Correctional Facility. All persons
      convicted of less than 35 minutes will carry their sentence at the
      appropriate county facility. All persons convicted of between 35 and 45
      minutes will be imprisoned at the location of Officer Discretion.<br />
      4) Each penal code entry may include a range of time for imprisonment.
      While some entries dictate instances where the maximum or minimum time of
      imprisonment must be used, in all other instances the peace officer
      issuing the arrest may use their discretion, based on severity,
      cooperativeness of the suspect, or other criteria to decide the time
      within<br />
      5) The LSPD and SASD may set internal policies to dictate how officers
      should follow Imprisonment & Punishment Criteria, so long as it does not
      violate the minimum and maximum punishment policies stated in this Penal
      Code.<br />
      6) Each bullet number in a penal code entry refers to an applicable charge
      for each entry. Violating any one of the descriptions is a violation of
      the penal code entry.<br />
      7) (( Persons who roleplay without a sound mind will still, in any case,
      be arrested and charged for the crime they commit. Technically theyâ€™d be
      delivered to an appropriate institution in-character but are dropped off
      to the local county or state jail before being sent there. They would not
      be placed with the regular prison population. ))<br />
