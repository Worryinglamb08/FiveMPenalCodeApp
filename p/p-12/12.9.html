      (12)09. Officer Discretion
    </h1>
    <h3 id="penalCodeSubHeader">
      <strong>1)</strong> Law enforcement officers shall have the authority to
      use their discretion when issuing infractions or select misdemeanors. This
      discretion entitles the officer to choose to forego an infraction or
      misdemeanor penalty based on their personal judgement.<br />
      2) Officers must choose to issue Officer Discretion and forego charging,
      not issue a fine or other punishment in lieu of the typical punishment.<br />
      3) Officers cannot elect Officer Discretion if the independent victim,
      property owner, or affected party chooses to press charges against the
      perpetrator.<br />4) Double Jeopardy still applies, meaning a senior
      officer cannot revoke Officer Discretion once it is issued unless it was
      issued in disregard for a party wishing to press charges.<br />
      5) All misdemeanors that fall under Officer Discretion shall state as such
      in the sentencing portion of the charge.
