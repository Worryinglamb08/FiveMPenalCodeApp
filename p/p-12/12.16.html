      (12)16. Criminal Fines
    </h1>
    <h3 id="penalCodeSubHeader">
      <strong>1)</strong> The Department of Justice may seek Criminal Fines
      through the State of San Andreas Court, to accompany imprisonment, for all
      felony and misdemeanor charges. The court shall impose a fine in all
      cases, except where the defendant establishes that he is unable to pay and
      is not likely to become able to pay any fine. A person who articulates and
      furnishes financial documentation to indicate financial difficulties with
      paying the fine shall be afforded additional time to pay the fine through
      a deadline established by the courts or through a payment plan to the
      Department of Justice. The fines may stack. The fines are as follows:<br />-
      $25,000 for any misdemeanor charges.<br />- $50,000 for any non-violent
      felony.<br />- $100,000 for any violent felony.<br />- $150,000 for (1)10.
      Murder<br /><br />
      NOTES: All fines paid shall be documented and a record shall be maintained
      by the Department of Justice. Fines may be used for expenses encumbered
      during the trial and any departmental authorized expenses.
