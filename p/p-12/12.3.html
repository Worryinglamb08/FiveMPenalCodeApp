      (12)03. Private Defense, Self Defense, Castle Doctrine, And Defense Of
      Others
    </h1>
    <h3 id="penalCodeSubHeader">
      <strong>1)</strong> A person who has a reasonable belief that they, or
      another, are in imminent danger of being killed, seriously injured or
      unlawfully touched and believe that imminent force is needed to prevent
      that danger and use no more force than is necessary to negate that danger
      will absolve of criminal liability in Title 1. Crimes Against the Person.
      ALL these requirements must be met to be completely absolved of criminal
      liability.<br />
      2) If not all requirements are met, charges may instead be reduced to up
      to half the minimum sentence for relevant offenses at the discretion of
      the peace officer or a judge.<br />3) This also applies in the case of a
      person who is protecting their home from imminent danger or robbery when
      on private property.<br />
      4) This defense cannot be applied in cases of gang on gang violence or in
      other such instances where the party claiming the defense was put at risk
      of immediate danger by their own involvement with actionable criminality.
