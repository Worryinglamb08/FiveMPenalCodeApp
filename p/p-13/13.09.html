        (13)09. Wiretapping Violation
    </h1>
    <h3 id="penalCodeSubHeader">
        <strong>1)</strong> A person who illegally conducts surveillance or wiretapping in violation of the one-party
        notification system without a warrant or authorization. <br><br>
        - Penal Code (13)09 is a felony punishable by no less than 90 minutes imprisonment and no more than 120 minutes
        imprisonment.

        <br><br>
        NOTES: Cops can charge this but usually a judge is the one who notes or acknowledges what is an illegal
        wiretapping operation. One-party notification means that at least one party being recorded visually or audibly
        is aware that they are being recorded and consents to it.
