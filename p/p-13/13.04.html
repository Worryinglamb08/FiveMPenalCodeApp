        (13)04. Medical Practice Violation
    </h1>
    <h3 id="penalCodeSubHeader">
        <strong>1)</strong> A person who identifies themselves as possessing a license to practice advanced medicine,
        whether verbally, or through implied means, and who has not received proper training to do so from the Los
        Santos Fire Department. <br />
        2) A person who performs or provides any medical services with criminal negligence, by criminal accident, or
        with the intent to cause harm to an individual.
        <br />
        3) A person who performs or provides any medical services not licensed or permitted by the Los Santos Fire
        Department after being explicitly notified by the Los Santos Fire Department to discontinue services in the
        State of San Andreas. <br>
        4) This charge cannot stack with (1).06 Attempted Murder. <br><br>

        - Penal Code (13)04 is a felony punishable by 150 minutes imprisonment. <br><br>

        NOTES: This charge covers any harm that happens as a result of criminal negligence or an intent to cause harm,
        but Murder stacks with this charge if the person dies as a result of the negligence or intentional harm.
        This does not cover doctors who are forced to act out of threat, by order of a government authority, or in other
        cases that would put them in harmâ€™s way if they do not act.
